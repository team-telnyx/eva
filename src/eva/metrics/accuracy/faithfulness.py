    "names, dropped syllables), but the assistant cannot know what the user actually said beyond what the "

    "own audio understanding. If the assistant misheard the user and used incorrect information in a tool "
    "call or response, that IS a faithfulness issue — accurate audio understanding is part of the "

_S2S_DISAMBIGUATION_CONTEXT = (
    "Since the assistant processes raw audio directly (speech-to-speech), it should account for potential "

    "disambiguation is higher than for a text-based system because the assistant knows it is working from "
